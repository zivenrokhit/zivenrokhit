## Hi there, my name is Ziven ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Software Engineer and a Mathematics/Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

I've interned at Ford Motors, TD Bank, and other tech startups.

In addition to my work experience and studies I've also founded a software company called Course Clutch (courseclutch.com) which helps university students enroll into in-demand courses!
